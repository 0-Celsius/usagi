Website Description:
This website is meant to be a very basic usage of css, html, and images. It is suppose to showcase Usagi from the hit series
Chiikawa. Where it explores the life of different cute creatures and their daily lifes. I decided to focus on one of my favorite character, Usagi,
simply because hes the best.

I tried my best in making the header very self explaination inhopes of reducing the need for a crazy amount of comments.
